# Rest-API

This is a simple web application that uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to give you a quick overview and rating of the latest popular movies. You can also search movies of your choice to get spoiler-free overview and rating.

This project was inspired by 50 projects-50 days for learning the implementation of APIs.
